Our lecture tasked us to create our own game which we can play on the server. 
I chose tic-tac-toa, the game is created in python language.
The OXO game client project aimed to develop an engaging and modernized version of tic-tac-toe with a Two-player mode and a visually appealing user interface. 
I created a thread so that the speed and responses of the GUI could work effectively and efficiently.
The game is a two player, so there has to be two windows open, but one laptop opens the server.
To experience the full visuals of the game run the OXOGAMEGUI.py file for the final version of the project
